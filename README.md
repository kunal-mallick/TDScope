# TDScope

**Tagline:** _See beyond the surface—predict purity with precision._

TDScope is a smart analytics tool designed to predict Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) in water using environmental parameters like temperature, pH, and more. Built with machine learning, it transforms raw sensor data into actionable insights for water quality monitoring, sustainability, and public health.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Predict TDS using multiple water quality indicators
- Modular pipeline for data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training
- Visualizations for exploratory data analysis and prediction results
- Scalable architecture based on the Cookiecutter Data Science template
