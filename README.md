# TDScope

**Tagline:** _See beyond the surface—predict purity with precision._

TDScope is a smart analytics tool designed to predict Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) in water using environmental parameters like temperature, pH, and more. Built with machine learning, it transforms raw sensor data into actionable insights for water quality monitoring, sustainability, and public health.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Predict TDS using multiple water quality indicators
- Modular pipeline for data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training
- Visualizations for exploratory data analysis and prediction results
- Scalable architecture based on the Cookiecutter Data Science template

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **Data Ingestion**: Collect water quality data including temperature, pH, etc.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Transform raw data into model-ready features.
3. **Model Training**: Train regression models to predict TDS values.
4. **Evaluation**: Assess model performance using metrics like RMSE and R².
5. **Visualization**: Generate plots to interpret predictions and trends.

## 🛠️ Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kunal-mallick/TDScope.git
cd TDScope
pip install -e .
````

---

## 📊 Usage

Run the pipeline using Make:

```bash
make data        # Process raw data
make train       # Train the model
make predict     # Generate predictions
```

Or use individual scripts from `src/` for custom workflows.

## 📚 Documentation

Full documentation is available in the `docs/` folder. You can build it using Sphinx:

```bash
cd docs
make html
```
